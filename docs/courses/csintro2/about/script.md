# Programming Language

In this course, we commonly refer to the language being used as JavaScript, but this is a slight misnomer. The language we use has significant similarities to JavaScript, but there are a few differences to ease students into programming as a whole, rather than focusing solely on JavaScript. For more information on the language used in MakeCode, see the [Programming Language Documentation](https://www.makecode.com/language).
